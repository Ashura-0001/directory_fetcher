# Directory Fetcher

## A simple directory selector/fetcher

 HEY WANDERER !

 This is a directory fetching tool that works on the basic python package
 and its libraries wihtin the terminal itself without any need of additional
 libraries... This is a rare kind of tool that you most probably won't find
 in this large cosmos but if you are a beginner player you most probably
 needed this like I needed untill I learnt about tkinter and other stuff
 Hope you have a good journey throughout this cosmos
